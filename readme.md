# Crop-Thumbnails

"Crop-Thumbnails" is an Wordpress-Plugin for editing cropped image-sizes. Every wordpress-media-image that is defined via "add_image_size" could be defined as cropped image, but in the default Wordpress-Image-Editor you are not able to choose what part of the image should be shown. Thats where the plugin kicks in. "Crop-Thumbnails" provide an additional editor, which is available from all relevant positions in the backend.

## Installation

The plugin can be installed from the wordpress plugin repository.
